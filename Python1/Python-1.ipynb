    "**<font color=red>Note:</font>** If you haven't already, please begin downloading the [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) as soon as you can.  It's a large download and can be slow to download over wifi.  If needed, we also have a limited number of thumb drives with the Anaconda installers.  Please flag one of the staff if you need to copy the installer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get the Anaconda Distribution of Python 3.7 downloaded and installed on your computer\n",
    "* Learn to work with basic Python objects\n",
    "* Introduce Loops and Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose programming language that has become popular in a number of application areas.  Python can be easier to learn than some other languages because it emphasizes (human) readability and flexibility.  Python is [the third most used language on GitHub](https://octoverse.github.com/projects#languages); this popularity translates into a wide variety of packages (user-developed functionality) to apply Python to different problems and tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't worked with a programming language before, learning Python will introduce you to approaches and thought processes common to many similar programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scripting: writing code to automate labor-intensive, repeptitive tasks.  For example, extracting text from thousands of pdf files, and sorting them into directories based on the resulting text files.'\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quantitative analysis: specialized tools and functions for everything from fitting deep learning models with `tensorflow` to  creating interactive visualizations with `bokeh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Natural Language Processing: extracting text from different file formats and parsing and analyzing sentiment using tools from the `NLTK` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web development, Image processing, Web scraping, Acessing APIs, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are few things you can do in Python that can't also be done elsewhere!  If you already know one or more programming language, you'll have to decide where Python best fits or helps in your own workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=red>Warning!</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're already very comfortable with coding, you may find this workshop too simple.  You're welcome to come back next week for Python II, if you're already familiar with the concepts below and just need to learn the syntax.  You're also welcome to stay, review, and help other attendees!\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> <h1>0. Setup</h1> </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use macOS or Linux, then you most likely already have Python on your computer!  Python does not come with Windows, but it may be on your machine as part of other software (e.g. ArcGIS Desktop).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why not work with an existing installation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you've worked with Python already, your pre-existing installation may only include the bare minimum and may be an out of date version.  Therefore, we recommend installing a distribution, with Python and many useful add-ons already setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anaconda distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda packages the current version of Python 2 or 3 with over 150 packages included in the installation and supports hundreds of others.  This includes many of the most heavily used packages supporting data transformation and analysis, and software to manage and add new packages, create virtual environments, and more.\n",

    "\n",
    "Both Python 2 and Python 3 are widely used in research.  Unfortunately, while both Python 2 and 3 are very similar, they are not completely compatible.  Python 3 was released in 2008; nearly all important tools have been re-written or updated for Python 3.  Python 2 will no longer be supported after 2020.  This workshop will focus on Python 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "While not required, an IDE can make Python easier to use.  As you gain experience, you can choose whether an IDE is right for your uses.  For the purposes of this workshop, we will use the Spyder IDE, which comes packaged with Anaconda.\n",
