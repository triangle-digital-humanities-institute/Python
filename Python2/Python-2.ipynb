    "As you get started coding in Python, there will be many many tasks and steps you aren't familiar with!  As you learn new functions and approaches, you'll become better and better at searching for help online and reviewing documentation.  Learning to write and use pseudocode where appropriate can help organize your plan for any individual script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode is essentially a first draft of your code, written in English for **human consumption**, though with the tools of your programming language in mind.  For example, we might write pseudocode for extracting text from pdf files as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Set Working Directory (tell the computer where we've saved our files)\n",
    "    2. Loop through each pdf in the directory:\n",
    "        * open the pdf file\n",
    "        * extract text\n",
    "        * check length of text extracted\n",
    "            * if length is zero: add to problems list\n",
    "            * otherwise, add to output file\n",
    "    3. Write output file(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can divide a complicated task into more digestible parts.  You may not know how to open a pdf file or extract text from it, but you'll often have better luck finding existing help online on smaller tasks like these than with your overall goal or project.\n",

The Anaconda Prompt window can be reached through the Windows Start Menu folder for Anaconda or right clicking and opening a terminal from the Python 3 tab in your Evnironments tab of your Anaconda Navigator on a Mac.\n",

    "<a href=\"http://www.numpy.org/\">`numpy`</a> provides the mathematical functionality (e.g. large arrayes, linear algebra, random numbers, etc.) for many popular statistical and machine learning tasks in Python.  This is a dependency for many of the packages we discuss below.  <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/\">`scipy`</a> adds an array of mathematical and statistical functions that work with `numpy` objects. \n",

    "### pandas \n",
    "\n",
    "The <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/\"> `pandas` package</a> provides high-level data manipulation functionality, similar to that found by default in R.  That means new objects like data frames and time series, as well as new functions to manage missing values, merge, and/or reshape datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we load pandas with the usual `import pandas` and an extra `as pd` statement.  This allows us to call functions from `pandas` with `pd.<function>` instead of `pandas.<function>` for convenience.  `as pd` is not necessary to load the package. \n",
