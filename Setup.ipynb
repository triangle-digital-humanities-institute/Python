    "### Why not work with an existing installation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you've worked with Python already, your pre-existing installation may only include the bare minimum and may be an out of date version.  Therefore, we recommend installing a distribution, with Python and many useful add-ons already setup, for all operating systems.\n",

    "Anaconda packages the current version of Python 2 or 3 with over 150 packages included in the installation and supports hundreds of others.  This includes many of the most heavily used packages supporting data transformation and analysis, and software to manage and add new packages, create virtual environments, and more.\n",

It's a large download and can be slow to download over wifi.  If needed, we also have a limited number of thumb drives with the Anaconda installers.  Please flag one of the staff if you need to copy the installer.\n",
